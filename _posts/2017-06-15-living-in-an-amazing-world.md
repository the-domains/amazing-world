# Living in an amazing world

The world is an amazing place and we offer the best content about life in general, whether it is city life or the beauty of nature.

## The hidden world

_July 2017 by Bruce W Berry Jr._

This video was created by [Bruce W. Berry Jr.][0]. He doesn't only show amazing creative skills, but he also shows what \#AmazingWorld is all about. We will be sharing more of his work here, because this man is such an inspiration to all of us. Thanks Bruce!

### This is what Bruce has to say about this video

This is the latest installment to the wonderland series. This infrared time-lapse is actually a prequel to "The Day Wonderland Stood Still". I started this project a few months before I started "The Day Wonderland Stood Still", but wasn't able to complete it until this year due to some of the locations being a bit harder to get to, the changing of the seasons and just being plain busy.

In this time-lapse video I wanted to introduce the hidden world of infrared photography and take you through a journey of my interpretation of "Wonderland". The making of this video involved the use of various motion controlled devices and hyperlapse photography (which was incredibly challenging to shoot in the woods). Footage was captured in Fairmount Park, Wissahickon Valley Park and Belleplain State Forest, all near or in the Philadelphia area.

For this Infrared video, I used a "Red filter" or sometimes referred to as the "Goldie filter" instead of a yellow filter I used in the last project. Like in the previous infrared time-lapse I used a "Full Spectrum Camera" to make this video.
